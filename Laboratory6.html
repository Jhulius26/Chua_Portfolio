        connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which <br>
        any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both <br>
        connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of <br>
        languages called <em>"protocols"</em>.
        <br><br>

        with medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is build on top <br>
        of the internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages <br>
