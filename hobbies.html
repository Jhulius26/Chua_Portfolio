                    In my free time, sometimes I play online games which helps me strategize and relieve my stress and confusion.
                    <br><br>
                    Everytime I got a free time at home, I played most of the time to not get bored, but sometimes I just want to
                    rest. Its not like my life is dedicated to these games, I used these games to forgot my problems and after playing, 
                    I resume what I needed to do.

                    I watch an anime also, typically I learn something in life because of this but never forget the experience that we gain. I used Anime
                    to ease my time and get interestings facts.
                    <br><br>
                    I watch it once a week by waiting its release because one episode of every anime can produce one in a week, it is not bad to watch once
                    a week, it makes the anime interesting and make your time freely.

                    Basketball is my childhood sport where I found out teamwork and physical fitness, although this sport is where I got my nightmare that hunts
                    me for a long time, but I overcome it and still today I still play this sport for body fitness.
                    <br><br>
                    When I have a free time or I just want to play and soem of my neighbors wants to play with me, thats when I play only. Also when I feel like
                    I need to exercise my body and my mind I play.

                    I love also motorcycle riding, it makes my skill in driving be more better and better to keep me safe while driving fast.
                    <br><br>
                    Typically I do it even there is no place to go like school, erands, and buying somethings, but now I ride only when I want and need to go 
                    somewhere like going to school.
