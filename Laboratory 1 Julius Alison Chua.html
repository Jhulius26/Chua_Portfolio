        <h1>Internet and the World Wide Web</h1> 
        <p>Many people use the terms <strong>Internet</strong> and the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> interchangeably, <br> 
        but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two <br>
        seperated but related things.
        <br><br>

        The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It <br>
        connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which <br>
        any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both <br>
        connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of <br>
        languages called <em>"protocols"</em>.
        <br><br>

        The <strong>World Wide Web </strong>or simply <em>"Web"</em>, is a way of accessing information over <br>
        with medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is build on top <br>
        of the internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages <br>
        spoken over the internet, to transmit data.</p>
